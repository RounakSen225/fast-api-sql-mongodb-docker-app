# fast-api-sql-mongodb-docker-app
A Rest app which uses Fast API for microservice, SQLite and MongoDB for databases, and Docker for containerization. Download the requirements for both apps using requirements.txt in both folders. A virtual environment is recommended. Set environment variables before running. A data file called "player.csv" is required to run the sql app, this file may need some test data to run the app, but can be empty as well.
